# Coder Coder Dark

![version number](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/codercoder.codercoder-dark-theme.svg)

Here is the VS Code theme that I use in all my [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/thecodercoder). I like dark themes so it's dark :) 

I took inspiration from the [Community Material](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-community-material-theme) and the [Dark+ Material](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vangware.dark-plus-material) themes.

💥 If you like this theme and would like to support me making cool stuff on here and YouTube, you can [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/thecodercoder) on GitHub!

Will be maintaining this as I have time, thanks for your understanding! 🙏🏽
